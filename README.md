👋 Hello, I'm Asia Qayoum!
AI Engineering Student | Deep Learning & Quantum Computing Enthusiast | Agentic AI Explorer

✨ About Me
🎓 Third-Year AI Engineering Student with a passion for pushing boundaries in Machine Learning & Deep Learning

⚛️ Fascinated by Quantum Computing and its potential to revolutionize AI

🤖 Selected for AI Skillbridge Bootcamp – Immersed in cutting-edge Agentic AI training

🧠 Obsessed with autonomous systems and creating AI that thinks and acts independently

🌱 Currently sharpening my skills in Agentic AI architectures, Python, and NLP applications

🚀 Current Focus: Agentic AI Frontiers
I'm exploring how AI systems can:
✅ Make context-aware decisions autonomously
✅ Learn dynamically from minimal human feedback
✅ Adapt to uncertainty like biological systems
✅ Collaborate with humans as intelligent partners

"Traditional AI follows rules – Agentic AI understands intent."

🔬 Active Project: Sentiment Analyzer for Short Texts
A compact NLP model designed for micro-content analysis (tweets, chat messages, headlines)

Key Features:
🎯 High-accuracy classification (positive/neutral/negative) even with minimal text

🏗️ Modular architecture for easy integration into larger Agentic AI systems

📊 Visual analytics dashboard for interpretability

Tech Stack:
🐍 Python | 🤗 Transformers (BERT/RoBERTa) | 🧮 PyTorch | 📊 Streamlit

"This project serves as both an NLP exercise and a building block for future Agentic AI communication systems."

🌐 Where I'm Growing Next
Short-Term: Enhance my Agentic AI toolkit through the AI Skillbridge program

Mid-Term: Explore quantum machine learning hybrid architectures

Long-Term: Develop AI systems that autonomously solve real-world problems
